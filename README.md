# WebCodingChallengeAuth

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

Web Coding Challenge, a single page app with a sign-up form.

Used Angular meterial for some components.
Used fortawesome for icon. (Can also be used default meterial icon, I love font-awsome icons)
Used ngx-ui-loader for loading
Used sweetalert2 for confirmation message

Are choices of libraries, architecture etc. appropriate for the task?

For the task, this project can be much more, or over think. However, just giving only sign-up form, that is not suits me. Enjoy cat vote! :)
